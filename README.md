This repository contains the complete analysis workflow for the study **"Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis of Dengue-infected Human Samples"**, which investigates immune responses and metabolic reprogramming during DENV infection. The project includes **data preprocessing**, **quality control**, **read alignment**, **gene expression analysis**, and **metabolic modeling** using tools such as **Cell Ranger**, **Seurat**, and **Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)** frameworks. All code, along with detailed step-by-step explanations, is documented in an interactive **Quarto handbook**, available at:
