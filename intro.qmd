## Experiment Design {.unnumbered}

This study integrates multiple single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets to investigate host responses to dengue virus (DENV) infection with a focus on immune dynamics and metabolic reprogramming. The analysis incorporates data from both controlled experimental infections and natural clinical cases, providing a comprehensive view of the human response to DENV.

1.  Human Challenge Study (Public Dataset 1)

The first dataset originates from a controlled human challenge study, where five healthy volunteers were experimentally infected with DENV under clinical supervision. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at six time points post-infection (e.g., days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), enabling a detailed time-resolved analysis of the immune response as the infection progressed. This longitudinal design allows for modeling early host responses and tracking dynamic changes in cellular states and gene expression patterns.

2.  Natural Infection Cohort (Public Dataset 2)

The second public dataset includes samples from five individuals naturally infected with dengue virus in an endemic setting. These samples represent real-world, acute-phase infections and serve as an external validation for the patterns observed in the challenge study. Unlike the time-resolved design of the first dataset, this cohort provides a snapshot of the host response during peak infection.

3.  In-House Clinical Dataset (New Data)

Additionally, we generated a new scRNA-seq dataset from a clinical study conducted at our institute. This dataset includes 10 dengue-infected patients and 10 healthy control individuals, with PBMCs collected during the acute phase of infection. This independent cohort enhances the robustness of our findings and supports cross-cohort comparison.
